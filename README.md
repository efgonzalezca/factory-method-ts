# 📖Description
The Factory Method pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. In this project, we use the Factory Method pattern to create notification objects based on the type of notification requested by the client. For more information, see [Factory Method](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method).
